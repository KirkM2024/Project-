# 8-1 Journal: Portfolio Submission
This is a submission for my college. I chose my thrid project to submit.

Questions.

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

2. What did you do particularly well?

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Answers.

1. Create a simple grocery list tracking program which takes in a test file. The program should allow you to search for a product and see how many time the item was searched. 
You should also be able to print out the items and how many times they were searched, one in the form of integers the second as a Histogram.

2. I feel like there was probably a way i could have transfered the data to the map better. for more secure code i could of changed when data was copied over. Also the code doesn't update the times searched when you search since the project didn't ask for it, this can probably just be as simple as using a built in function to add to the map when you search for an item.

3. I feel like reading and creating the file was the easiest task.
  
4. I found the most challenging was converting the file to a multimap and finding a way to update it's own pairs with the frequency searched. How i over came this was using Zybooks and school supported websites
to get an Idea of how maps work and could be manipulated forthe purpose of this project.

5. The skills i found that i could transfer is the data structures used and how to find information if you are stuck and properly adapt it to your program.

6. I used OOP principles to keep the core functyions seperate from main and included detailed comments.
